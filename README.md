# Hackfest 2017, Insta Insights

For the Hackfest the team eventually decided on making an Instagram analytics mobile first web app. The goal was to OAuth and be able to query the Instagram API but due to time restrictions and the sandbox mode, we eventually had to settle for the Node.js server to provide "live" dummy data to the client.

Some of the code is pretty messy, after all, it was "hacked" out. The team used GitHub and Agile methodologies to aid in efficient somewhat parallel development.

The end goal would be to provide more working features and expand the service to other social media platforms.
